# Fantasy Name Generator

## Inspiration & To=Do
- I want to create a wrapper for some LLM (going to self-host an LLM to test myself) that is fine-tuned to generate fantasy names based off a character description.
- It will have a front-end and a back-end. I plan to use some modern framework for the front-end and some new fangled one for the back-end to keep me up to date.
- It will use kubernetes to run everything as I need to learn Kubernetes
- It will also use the Cloud, probably AWS or Azure, and there will be a Terraform file for deploying it
